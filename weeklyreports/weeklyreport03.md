Weekly Report (2013-7-1 - 2013-7-7)
=====================================

What I have done:
-----------------
In this week I began to instrument the jitcode generated by the Baseline compiler.
We use block counters instead of branch buffers because the former data structure
is easier to implement and we want to get things work as quick as possible.
Currently only JSOP_IFEQ and and JSOP_IFNE are instruemented.
Some bugs remain in the patch, which need to be fixed in the next week.


Deliverables:
-------------
[instrumentation patch using block counters] TBD.

What I am planning to do next week:
-----------------------------------
1. Instrument all jumps in the Baseline generated jitcodes.
2. Fix the bugs existing in the patch.
